This year, we developed a sleek new look for focusing just on The Brown Fund. However, its pages still included a countdown, social integration, and real-time charts to engage donors worldwide. The site hosted <strong>4,888 visitors</strong>, who on average spent <strong>2 minutes</strong> there. Giving Tuesday 2019 raised over <strong>$3.7 million dollars from 4,706 donors</strong>.</p>

Though sharing similarities, this site was a single page that needed to gracefully load and display real-time totals for nearly 30 individual sports teams. We also added top 5 rankings by both donors and dollars new for this day, as well as a brand-new, dynamic design. <strong>4,538 supporters</strong> came out to root for their favorite teams on this first-ever giving day just for Brown Bears teams, making it a success from the get-go.

Adding a second annual giving day was a large endeavor. Similar to Brunonians Pay It Forward Day, I managed, maintained, built, tested, and coded this site from scratch. It’s mobile-first, fluid, and incorporates fundraising goals for both The Brown Fund and Brown Bears Sports. Giving Tuesday 2018 raised over <strong>$3 million</strong> for the university from <strong>4,592 donors</strong>. <strong>2,767 users</strong> visited the site and stayed for an average of <strong>nearly 6 minutes</strong>.</p>

The Black Alumni Reunion commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Black Student Walkout, a historic event at the university, where Black students left class to protest the disproportionately small Black community and the few resources for those Black students that were there. This multi-page site was built, tested, and managed by me, with some design input as well. It included a countdown, social media feed, event download, and served as the main information source for the event and all its details over the weekend. Participants wrote in to tell us how much they enjoyed this gathering with their classmates and how significant it was for them. A few of the students who originally walked out 50 years ago also attended. The site logged <strong>562 users</strong> and view times averaged <strong>5 minutes</strong>. <strong>700 people attended</strong> the event.</p>

With my predecessor switching to a new position, I took the initiative to learn our new content management system (BBIS), intimately, and built out the site locally, then parsed it into Layouts, Templates, Pages, and Parts in the system, pulling everything back together. Working off of a design file, I built the site myself from soup to nuts, the first in what became a long string of giving day sites. Volunteers, alumni, staff, and donors all came to rely on the site as a way to get real-time updates on the day via integrated charts as well as information on its importance. The giving day raised <strong>$2.3 million from 3,663 donors</strong>.</p>
