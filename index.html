I create custom Gutenberg blocks, plugins, and forward-thinking sustainable solutions for ongoing projects. I also specialize in spinning up sites with semantic HTML5 and creating graceful and fluid mobile-first sites using CSS/Sass. (Like this one!) I love the ever-changing nature of the field&mdash;always something new to learn!&mdash; and the different mental modes of design/styling and problem-solving. On my days off, I enjoy reading, drawing, hiking, and exploring. I'm excited to help you bring your ideas to life!<br /><a href="mailto:c.smith@gatech.edu">Email me</a> <a href="https://github.com/court-smith">Github</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtsmithwebdesigner" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>

              <p>Hosting expert-informed news and university happenings alike, <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu" target="_blank">Northeastern Global News</a> is the product of Northeastern's Communications team. Built in Wordpress, it hosts a decade-worth of content as well as various microsites. I create custom plugins, post types, taxonomies, Gutenberg blocks, and uniquely designed pages to ensure that our content can be accessed around the clock as news breaks. Standout solo work includes creating the top and side navigations with a nav walker and footer design and developtment. In addition to the day to day maintenance and updates, I've also developed and executed our plan to transfer the site from WP Engine to Wordpress VIP, participated in a large-scale redesign, and guided multiple weekly deployments. Finally, I also develop and maintain our microsites <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/magazine/" target="_blank">NGN Magazine</a> and
                <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/research/" target="_blank">NGN Research</a> with others on the team.</p>
              <h6>How I made it happen:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>Researched, diagrammed, and developed a multi-layered nav walker to show categories of posts and then the 3 most recent posts within each category.</li>
                <li>Coded the side navigation's elements to populate dynamically and slide in on open.</li>
                <li>Used PHP to spin up the footer and styled with SCSS.</li>
                <li>Develop and update blocks with PHP, JavaScript, React, and SCSS.</li>
                <li>Continuously collaborate with other developers using Git, GitHub, and NPM.</li>
                <li>Designed a plan to navigate the site from WP Engine to Wordpress VIP, which included exporting the database, reworking Twig files (Timber) to PHP, upgrading to PHP 8, converting from multi to single site, learning VIP CLI, and running multiple tests of the entire process.</li>

              <p>A specialty article to highlight the voices of young voters around campus on a tighter timeline, I created a simple but fun design to showcase their thoughts and concerns.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Worked with our Illustrator and Digital Media Director to create a design based off an inspiration article.</li>
                <li>Used JavaScript, GSAP, and ScrollTrigger to gracefully change the background color when you scroll.</li>
                <li>Reworked initial color palette slightly to ensure enough color contrast to meet WebAIM accessibility standards.</li>
                <li>Styled with SCSS to bring it all together.

              <p>To complement our coverage of Commencement, we decided to gather the live streams of the various ceremonies across the colleges and campuses into a series of pages on NGN. This was originally meant to be a long-term process and each page could be spun up a few days before the corresponding ceremony. Therefore, I created a spreadsheet with each ceremony name, embed link, and date (I was specifically given this project because I was told "you're the most organized person I know"&mdash;an honor). I made a plan to create each of the 20+ pages over time, but unfortunately the deadline was pushed up by about a week. I created a plan with a collegue, quickly trained them, and we stayed late to finish the pages that same day. They were extremely successful and brought in a large bump of traffic to our site and converted new readers.</p>
              <h6>How I made it happen:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>Created a design based on some initial ideas and feedback, styled the page, and set it to be generated based on the page slug.</li>
                <li>Built out an unsynched pattern to quickly pull in the same content on each page.</li>
                <li>Ensured consistency across all of the 20+ pages.</li>
                <li>Post-mortem: Reflected that this was better served by creating a custom post type, for a variety of reasons, and since I knew the pages performed well and would be used again the following year, I spent the time to create a custom plugin and post type and transferred the content over for future sustainability.</li>

              <p>For this specialty article, I wanted to emphasize the remoteness of the location, as Svalbard is quite off the beaten path! To do this, I incorporated a video of a boat ride through the arctic waters as the header and an existing block we have to animate a map to zoom in on the location (please note this accounts for the space in the screenshots).</p>
              <h6>How I made it happen:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>Reviewed the story and assets, and developed then honed a design with the team.</li>
                <li>Styled the page with SCSS, ensuring mobile compatibility.</li>

              <p>As part of an initiative to engage various types of visitors to our site, I was tasked with creating a structure to support others in making additional pages for the <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/parents/" target="_blank">parents page</a>. I also created a separate custom taxonomy for audience type as related to this goal.</p>
              <h6>How I made it happen:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>Reviewed the existing design of the parents page, including colors and fonts, and drafted something against the kinds of content we expected to host.</li>
                <li>Created a custom post type with sample content in PHP.</li>
                <li>Designed the inidvidual pages and iterated on feedback.</li>
                <li>Wrapped it all in a custom plugin, tested, and deployed!</li>

            <p>I built the website for Giving Tuesday, which serves as the digital homebase for this fundraising event.

For this long-desired feature, I wrote the front-end code for a giving history page, allowing each donor to log in and see their support of Brown over the years.</p>
