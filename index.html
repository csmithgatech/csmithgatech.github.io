I specialize in spinning up sites with semantic HTML5 and creating graceful and fluid mobile-first sites using CSS/Sass. (Like this one!) I love the right brain/left brain of design with front-end development and the challenge of an ever-changing field. On my days off, I enjoy reading, playing video games, ice skating, and exploring. I'm excited to help you bring your ideas to life!<br /><a href="mailto:c.smith@gatech.edu">Email me</a> <a href="https://github.com/court-smith">Github</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtsmithwebdesigner" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>

              <p>Northeastern Global News is a daily news site created and maintained by our team. Built in Wordpress, it hosts a decade worth of articles on current news and University happenings. Together with our team of developers, I create custom post types, taxonomies, Gutenberg blocks, and uniquely designed pages to ensure that our content can be accessed around the clock as news breaks. For the homepage specifically, I created the top and side navigations with a nav walker, and created the footer as well.</p>

            <p>I built the website for Giving Tuesday, which serves as the digital homebase for this fundraising event. The day after Cyber Monday, Giving Tuesday has become a major fundraising day for the university. This year was no exception as it raised <strong>nearly $2 million from 3,056 donors</strong>. The site itself hosted <strong>4,325 visitors</strong> who spent <strong>3 minutes</strong> there on average. 48% of them were on mobile.</p>
