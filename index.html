            <p>I built the website for Giving Tuesday, which drums up excitement for the day, stokes inter-class competition, and provides resources for volunteers. The day after Cyber Monday, Giving Tuesday has become a major fundraising day for the university. This year was no exception as it raised <strong>nearly $2 million from 3,056 donors</strong>. The site itself hosted <strong>4,325 visitors</strong> who spent <strong>3 minutes</strong> there on average. 48% of them were on mobile.</p>

Adding a second annual giving day was a large endeavor. Similar to Pay It Forward Day, I managed, maintained, built, tested, and coded this site from scratch. It’s mobile-first, fluid, and incorporates fundraising goals for both the Brown Fund and Brown Bears Sports. Giving Tuesday 2018 raised over <strong>$3 million</strong> for the university from <strong>4,592 donors</strong>. <strong>2,767 users</strong> visited the site and stayed for an average of <strong>nearly 6 minutes</strong>.</p>
          <h6>How I made it happen:</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Interpreted flat designs from the graphics team for a variety of screen sizes</li>
            <li>Developed the site locally in mobile-first, semantic HTML5 and Sass</li>
            <li>Evaluated the style guide for accessibility with color contrast</li>
            <li>Loaded different parts of the code into the CMS, mindful of user access and reusability</li>
            <li>Developed a pixel-perfect scalable top banner, where different content would be swapped out periodically</li>
            <li>Created a different layout for each page, each with its own mobile behavior</li>
            <li>Ran a testing regimen on a variety of devices</li>
            <li>Managed the project to make sure various deliverables from different teams arrived in good time</li>
            <li>Iterated on internal and external feedback from critiques, doing further testing</li>
            <li>Integrated real-time results charts and social sharing</li>
            <li>Launched the before state early, and managed the on-the-dot switchover for giving day go-live</li>
            <li>Completed the site by activating the day after state</li>

The Black Alumni Reunion commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Black Student Walkout, a historic event at the university, where Black students left class to protest the disproportionately small Black community and the few resources for those Black students that were there. This multi-page site was built, tested, and managed by me, with some design input as well. It included a countdown, social media feed, event download, and served as the main information source for the event and all its details over the weekend. Participants wrote in to tell us how much they enjoyed this gathering with their classmates and how significant it was for them. A few of the students who originally walked out 50 years ago also attended. The site logged <strong>562 users</strong> and view times averaged <strong>5 minutes</strong>. <strong>700 people attended</strong> the event.</p>

            <li>Coded semantic HTML5 and Sass, creating the mobile-first site locally first</li>
            <li>Segmented and loaded into our CMS, BBIS</li>
            <li>Created, laid out, and maintained multiple pages of event details down to individual workshops, hotel information, and speaker information</li>
            <li>Ran a testing regimen on a variety of devices</li>
            <li>Integrated internal and external feedback from critiques, doing further testing</li>
            <li>Met an aggressive deadline to have the site live only a month after Pay It Forward Day, while balancing multiple other projects</li>

With my predecessor switching to a new position, I took the initiative to learn our new CMS, BBIS, intimately, and built out the site locally, then parsed it into Layouts, Templates, Pages, and Parts in the system, pulling everything back together. Working off of a design file, I built the site myself from soup to nuts, the first in what became a long string of giving day sites. Volunteers, alumni, staff, and donors all came to rely on the site as a way to get real-time updates on the day via integrated charts as well as information on its importance. The giving day raised <strong>$2.3 million from 3,663 donors</strong>.</p>

        <figcaption><p><time>February 2017</time><br />Shortly after joining Brown, I helped to build out Brunonia in our new Drupal platform. I created stories and articles, and worked on the design for the logged in experience in BBIS. Refreshing my knowledge of Drupal and learning the ins and outs of the BlackBaud CMS, this project required extreme adaptability, late nights, and polished CSS skills. Brunonia was a major informational hub for university events, fundraising information, and the real-world results from the campaign. (Brunonia was retired in the Summer of 2020.)</p></figcaption>
